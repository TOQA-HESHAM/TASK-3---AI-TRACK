# TASK-3---AI-TRACK



Task Name: Turtle Drawing and Construct Game Creation

Objective:
The goal of this task is to explore programming concepts through two engaging activities: using Python's Turtle graphics library to create visual designs, and using Construct to develop an interactive game without traditional coding.

Steps Followed:

Understanding the Requirements:
Read and analyzed the task requirements to clearly understand the objectives and expected results.

Turtle Drawing Implementation:

Used Python’s Turtle library to draw shapes and patterns.

Applied movement commands to control the turtle’s direction and distance.

Experimented with colors and positions to create the desired design.

Saving and Running the Turtle Program:

Saved the turtle code in a .py file.

Ran the file to visualize the design output.

Construct Game Creation:

Opened the Construct platform to start a new game project.

Added a player sprite and other game objects.

Defined object properties such as position, size, and movement behavior.

Game Event Logic:

Created events and actions to control game behavior (e.g., player movement, collisions).

Used Construct’s visual scripting system to implement gameplay rules.

Testing the Game:

Ran the game in preview mode to test all functionalities.

Made adjustments to improve movement, responsiveness, and design.

Final Review:
Verified that both the turtle drawing and the Construct game met the task’s objectives before submission.
